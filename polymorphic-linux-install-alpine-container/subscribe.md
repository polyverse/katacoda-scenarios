Polymorphic Linux is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all of the existing packages on your
host. To use, simply point your package repository to the Polyverse repositories instead of a community run “mirror”. From then on, Polymorphic Linux operates identically to standard Linux.

We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors, with a personalized key found on your individual
[account page](https://polyverse.com/account). For this demo, we'll use an install script from a demo account.

`curl https://sh.polyverse.io | sh -s install i3BIaA6dfTmsK4bFNWIgHwJr6 webdemo@polyverse.io`{{execute}}
