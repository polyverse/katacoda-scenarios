Polymorphic Linux is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all the existing packages on an existing Linux
host, by pulling them from a Polyverse "mirror".

We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors, with a personalized key found on your individual
[account page](https://polyverse.com/account). For this demo, we'll use an install script from a demo account.
