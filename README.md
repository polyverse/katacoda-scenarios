Polyverse Katacoda scenarios

This website also powers [Polyverse Learning](https://polyverse.io/learn),
through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT AUTHKEYS

We had keys from various orgs being used for Katacoda demos. They now
come from this single org: https://polyverse.com/account/org/2a041da04bf15b8064b708594df593ee/authkeys

If you don't have access to it, please request access. Begin deprecating other orgs
that do the same thing.

This will allow for visibility, but also allows the upcoming
Detect keys to be consolidated in one place for all demos.
