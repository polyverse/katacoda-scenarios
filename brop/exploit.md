Now that Nginx is installed, let's break into it using this step-by-step script. This script follows the steps outlined in this [Blind ROP Whitepaper](https://polyverse.com) that you may want to have open for reference.

1. Select one of the options to run the remote attacker container:
    * If you'd like to execute the entire attack all in one shot, run this command:

    `docker run --rm --link target -it polyverse/exp-nginx-1.4.0-brop target`{{execute "T2"}}

    * If you want to pause after after each step, to follow what is happening, run this instead:

    `docker run --rm --link target -it polyverse/exp-nginx-1.4.0-brop -p target`{{execute "T2"}}

2. Once the attack is completed, you should have a remote shell into nginx and you should be able to play in it.

*NOTE: The complete source code for the exploit is provided here: https://github.com/polyverse/exp-nginx-1.4.0-brop. The attack can be executed against any endpoint running vulnerable nginx.*
