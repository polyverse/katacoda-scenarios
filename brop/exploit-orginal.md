Now that Nginx is installed, let's exploit the original version and see what happens.

`exploit`{{execute}}

Take a look at our dashboard:

[Dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)

As you can see, the exploit was successful and went undetected. No matter how many times you run the exploit no alert will appear on the dashboard.
In a similar way, attackers, when they successfully exploit your system, can go undetected for a very long time, opening up huge risks for you.
