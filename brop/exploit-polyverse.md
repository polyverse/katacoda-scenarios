Now let's try the same exploit on the polymorphic version of Nginx and see what happens.

`exploit`{{execute}}

The exploit failed to run, and it's failure has been logged in our dashboard, alerting you that your systems are actively under attack.

You can run the exploit as many times as you want, it'll continue to fail, and you'll see more activity on the dashboard.

Now that you know, you can proactively take measures to discover the source of the attack, and shut it down.
