We've had [Zerotect](https://github.com/polyverse/zerotect) running in the background attempting to detect just this class of attack.

You may navigate to the terminal that says `Zerotect Detector`, or look for the specific event which indicates an attack took place:

`cat /var/log/zerotect.log | grep "" `{{execute T5}}

Get in touch with us if you'd like to see the mitigations in action.
