Exploiting Buffer Overflows is far simpler than widely assumed. Detecting ROP attacks on the network is difficult, if not impossible, because they're just regular valid packets.

They do, however, leave loud noisy side-effects on the victim if one knows where to look. If you'd like to detect attacks on your own hosts, we recommend the [Open Source Zerotect agent](https://github.com/polyverse/zerotect).

If you'd like to defend against these attacks proactively on the zeroth day, i.e. to gain complete immunity against this class of attacks, consider [Polymorphing for Linux](https://polyverse.com/products/polymorphing-linux-security/).
