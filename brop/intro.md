Exploit an Nginx buffer overflow vulnerability to open a remote shell.

This tutorial is described in detail and step by step in this [Blind ROP Whitepaper](https://polyverse.com/resources/blind-rop-whitepaper), with useful diagrams of memory maps. You are encouraged to read it or have it open as the attack progresses.

The whitepaper is based on the seminal paper on [Blind Return-Oriented Programming attacks from Stanford University](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/bittau-brop.pdf), and uses the (now-patched) vulnerability [CVE-2013-2028 vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2013-2028).

This is an excellent way to study and learn how a real buffer overflow exploit works.

Let's proceed...
