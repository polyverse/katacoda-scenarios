This guide simulates how we can use Polyverseâ€™s no click security solution for Linux to detect intrusions. The tutorial will walk through the exploitation of a non-Polyversed instance using a buffer overflow and the detection of the same exploit on a Polyversed instance.

In four simple steps learn how our Polymorphic Linux solution, detects, defends, and deters threats. These attacks are logged and sent to the SIEM of your choice, giving you unprecedented visibility into zero-day cyberattacks.
