Polymorphing is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all the existing packages on an existing Linux
host, by pulling them from a Polyverse "mirror".


We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors, with a personalized key found on your individual
[account page](https://polyverse.com/account). For this demo, we'll use an install script from a demo account.

`curl https://sh.polyverse.io | sh -s install tR3pfxuoH2psdW23ZVTJzRgvF webdemo@polyverse.io`{{execute}}
