Polymorphic Linux is distributed as drop-in replacement packages for all of the existing packages on your host. To use, simply point your package repository to the Polyverse repositories instead of a community run “mirror”. From then on, Polymorphic Linux operates identically to standard Linux.

We provide a simple script to subscribe to the mirrors, this command can found on the
[free trial page](https://polyverse.io/polymorphic-linux-installation-guide/) of our website or simply click the command below:

`curl https://sh.polyverse.io | sh -s install czcw7pjshny8lzzog8bgiizfr webdemo@polyverse.io`{{execute}}
